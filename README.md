# Velo-V
Interactive bike rental map VÃ©lo'V

You need to develop a "Single page Application" page simulating the reservation of bicycles in a city. 
These bikes are spread across many resorts in the city. The user must be able to book a bike from his browser 
(provided that there are still bikes available at the station!). The reservation is then temporarily saved on the visitor's 
browser.

This application must include, based on JavaScript, display a map with the list of bike rental stations available in the city.

The application must be developed in client-side JavaScript. 
You do not have to write any server-side code (the use of PHP or a Node.js server, in particular, is forbidden).
